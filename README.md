This repository is for the purpose of sharing my code, as I am taking the route of self teaching python.

These projects will mostly be practice projects with the aim of furthering my abilities, but I do enjoy being able to solve real world problems that apply to everyday life, so most projects will be for that purpose.

If anyone stumbles accross this code by accident, feel free to leave feedback and suggestions, as I would love to improve my coding abilities.
