This is a rough, command line version of an app that is designed to help track habits over periods of time. 

The best way to form a new habit is to do it everyday, even if you do as little as 2 - 5 minutes a day, it adds up.

Visual representation of your progress is a very good way to keep the habit going. After a while it becomes harder to not do the habit then to do it.
This is because after 1 or 2 weeks, seeing that you have done 7 - 14 days in a row, looks like a big number, and you will hate to see that number go back to 0.
