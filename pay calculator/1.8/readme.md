In this version I added the option of choosing tax years, increased the scalability, and cleaned/formatted some of the code.

If the tax rates were to change, or a new tax year was to start, now I can just go into the taxRates function and edit the rates/add the rates for the new year easily
This cleans the code up, and has allowed me to add the option of the user choosing which tax year they want to do the calculation for.
