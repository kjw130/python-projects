This pay calculator is for the purpose of calculating pay for time worked on a weekly bases.

The story is, with my current work, I get rostered on different hours throughout different weeks, so my pay for the week would always change.
Since there are so many different penalty rates and taxes to keep track of, calculating my pay for the week would be a 5 - 10 minute process,
where I would need to use a pen, paper and a calculator.
Since I couldn't be bothered manually doing these calculations every sunday afternoon when I get my hours, I decided to write a program that would do it for me.

Version 1 is what the pay calculator started as, and every version afterwards includes upgrades to the code, and bonus features, 
following along with my learning while using python.

This is the first project I have made with the aim of solving a real world problem.
