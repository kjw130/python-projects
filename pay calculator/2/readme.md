While working a new project, I came to the realisation of how I was previously writing my code was very very poor quality,
This realisation prompted me to go back and edit this entire project, as the previous style was very buggy and looked horrible. 

Also put the main function in a loop, now the user will have the option to replay the app if they want to try again.

I will still need to edit this project at this point, but it's a step in the right direction.
